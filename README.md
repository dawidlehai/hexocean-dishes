# HexOcean Dishes

This is my solution to HexOcean’s recruitment task. The task was to write a simple form that sends request to the provided API endpoint with the user’s inputs.

To run this project locally:
1) download and unzip the package (or clone the repository),
2) run the command `npm install` from the folder where the package was unzipped,
3) run the command `npm run dev` to start the server,
4) open the URL displayed in the console.

This app was created, developed, and bundled with Vite. In the project, I used React + TypeScript and redux-form (although this library is depreciated and should be replaced by newer libraries like react-hook-form).

Node.js version: v18.13.0  
npm version: 9.6.2

I worked on this task for approximately 8 hours.
